---

## [5.5.5] 2019-02-22

### Fixed

- Fixes ordering logs by last event /ht @mikeal


---

## [5.5.2 - 5.5.4] 2019-02-20

### Fixed

- `logs` forces descending order
- Query params no longer trigger index.html override for `sandbox`
- Adds support for `text/tsx` in `/public`


---

## [5.5.1] 2019-02-08

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

### Removed

- `test:watch` script and `tape-watch` devdep (due to multiple dependencies with CVEs)


---

## [5.5.0] 2019-02-03

SPA support: mount S3 on the `/` of API Gateway

### Added

- `ANY /{proxy+}` will now route any 'not found' to the HTTP Lambda `src/http/get-index`
  - Note: proxy+ routes have a slightly different request payload that includes `request.requestContext` not available to regular HTTP Lambdas (so you can use this to test a 404 condition)
- `ANY /_static/{proxy+}` will proxy to S3 buckets defined by `@static` (if you want to skip proxying through Lambda)
- Companion library `@architect/functions` also gained `arc.proxy.public` superpower for proxying all requests NOT defined by `.arc` to the `@static` S3 buckets

[For more about single page apps with Architect see there docs here.](https://arc.codes/guides/spa)


### Changed

- If `@http` is defined, then `get /` must also be defined
- `npx sandbox` now mounts `/public` on `http://localhost:3333/_static` to match the deployed API Gateway S3 proxy


---

## [5.0.6] 2019-01-25

### Added

- Improvements to build plugins system (did you know Architect has a build plugins system?)
  - Now supports NPM scoping (e.g. `@architect/arc-plugin-node-prune`)
  - Build preparation order now runs pre-deploy build plugins last (after dependency hydration)
  - Published a companion beta / demo plugin: [`@architect/arc-plugin-node-prune`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@architect/arc-plugin-node-prune), clean the cruft out of your `node_modules`!


### Fixed

- Fixes `create` breaking if `@ws` is not present in `.arc`, #276


---

## [5.0.4] 2019-01-24

### Added

- `repl` now respects environments, allowing you to connect to your remote databases with the `NODE_ENV` environment variable


### Fixed

- `repl` was being clobbered by `@architect/data`'s own implementation; fixed in `arc-repos/arc-data` #12, dependency updated


### Changed

- Updated dependencies


---

## [5.0.2] 2019-01-22

### Added

- Support for `@ws` in `.arc` for generating WebSocket Lambdas and API Gateway endpoints
- Support for WebSocket Lambdas in the local sandbox
- WebSocket Lambdas support in `inventory`, which in turn powers most other workflows


### Removed

- Support for `@slack` as the more generic `@http` Lambdas support that use case better


### Fixed

- Fixes `@indexes` creation bug
- Runs `npm i` during `hydrate --update`, resolving a long-standing NPM issue where package-lock files may fall out of sync
- Fixed: on Windows, S3 assets will be correctly created relative to their location beneath `public` rather than their full paths.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies


---

## [4.5.6] 2019-01-14


### Fixed

- Fixes callback in _create-code task, fixes #263


### Changed

- Improved error handling in NPM operations


---

## [4.5.5] 2019-01-11

---

## [4.5.4] 2019-01-10


### Changed

- Improved status reporting during `deploy` and `create`


### Fixed

- Fixes cases where hydration was crashing single function deployments, and deployments that execute `create` for missing resources


---

## [4.5.1] 2019-01-08


### Changed

- `hydrate` refactor and API
  - NPM operations are now queued and concurrently processed (env var `ARC_MAX_NPM`, defaults to 10) /ht @grncdr
  - Vastly improved NPM error handling and related deployment reliability (fixes #141 + #151)
  - Now hydrates (and updates) deterministically from the current .arc manifest, as opposed to globbing
  - All NPM operations now use `npm ci` for more consistent behavior across environments
  - Updates `deploy` to use `hydrate` API, and `sandbox` to use new shared code copier module
- DynamoDB tables now use on-demand/pay-per-request billing mode, mitigating the need for capacity planning /ht @alexdilley
- `inventory` now supplies its own Arc project data, allowing it to be called as needed without relying on `util/init`


### Fixed

- Freshly created Functions are now properly hydrated with shared code (if available and appropriate; fixes #241)
- Running `create` on already existing projects now runs orders of magnitute faster
- `.arc` file is now reliably copied into each Function's `node_modules/@architect/shared` even if you don't use `src/shared` (needed by `@architect` deps)
- `deploy` now respects `--delete` flag when deploying the whole project
- Improved progress reporting in `CI` mode, and for `hydrate`, `create`, and `deploy`


### Added

- New command: `hydrate --shared [--update]` - hydrates and/or updates `src/shared` and `src/views` (if available)
- Added test run watcher script /ht @filmaj


---

## [4.4.12] - 2018-12-23


### Removed

The following folders are no longer required nor autogenerated:

- `src/shared`
- `src/views`
- `/public`

Functionality remains unchanged: Contents of `src/shared` are synced to `node_modules/@architect/shared` in all lambdas whenever deploying or using the sandbox. Contents of `src/views` are synced to all HTTP GET lambdas `node_modules/@architect/views`. Public is synced to S3 buckets.


---

## [4.4.11] - 2018-12-19


### Added

- Updates `sandbox`, adding minor performance tweaks now, and setting up for future enhancements
  - Updated `sandbox` to asynchronously read files when invoking a Lambdas
  - Updates runtime handling in `sandbox` to make it easier to add additional runtimes
  - Each runtime now lives in its own function, which also enables process forking later on


---

## [4.4.10] - 2018-12-18


### Added

- New logo (added to readme)! /ht @amberdawn
- `hydrate` and `deploy` now install dependencies in `src/shared` and `src/views` (#240)
- `QUIET` boolean env var suppresses init header (fixes #238)
  - Helpful for piping data to disk, e.g. setting up new users on an Architect project with `QUIET=1 npx env > .arc-env`
- `app.arc` app filename supported as a non-dotfile alternative to `.arc` (#239)


### Changed

- Static asset deploys now exclude default `public/readme.md` file
- Improved `hydrate` progress and completion confirmation
- Adds Architect version back into the init header


### Fixed

- `hydrate` was not properly globbing (and thus, not hydrating) `src/shared` contents


---

## [4.4.9] - 2018-12-16 (merge commit, no changes)


---

## [4.4.8] - 2018-12-12


### Added

- To help accommodate `sandbox` calling out to remote databases, `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` env var allows you specify in seconds how long `sandbox` should wait for all child processes to complete
  - `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT` is overridden by any directory-specific `.arc-config` files


### Changed

- Default `sandbox` timeout is now symmetrical with Architect's default Lambda timeout time of 5 seconds


---

## [4.4.7] - 2018-12-11


### Added

- Form-encoded POST values can now be sent enclosed in single quotes /ht @herschel666


### Changed

- Skip logging when `@static` isn't deployed
- Additional hardening of `sandbox` handling of JSON responses emitted from `@architect/functions`
- Preliminary / prototype commits for outputting CloudFormation from .arc
- Preliminary / prototype commits in the direction of adding arbitrary header support /ht @mweagle


### Fixed

- Issue where `arc.http` JSON responses were crashing `sandbox` due to an encoding mismatch
- Issue where `ARC_LOCAL` env var wasn't being properly respected by `sandbox` events


---

## [4.4.5] - 2018-12-7


### Added

- Local `@queues` now available in `sandbox`
- Big ups to @grncdr for this feature!


### Fixed

---

## [4.4.4] - 2018-12-1


### Added

- `deploy` operations now read local and remote last-modified times, and will skip files whose times don't differ, thereby speeding up deploy operations of static files
- Big ups to @filmaj for this release, too!


---

## [4.4.3] - 2018-11-30


### Added

- `npx deploy static`: deploys only `@static` assets (as found in the `public/` folder)
  - Accepts `staging | --staging | -s` and `production | --production | -p` flags
- `npx deploy static --delete`: deploys static assets, and deletes remote S3 files not present locally in `public/`
  - Can be used with `staging` and `production` flags
- Big ups to @filmaj for this release!


---

## [4.4.0] - 2018-11-27


### Added

- Large refactor of `deploy` workflow to improve stability and reliability
- `deploy` now identifies missing project resources during deploy operations
  - Instead of failing / throwing errors, `deploy` now completes its first pass deployment
  - Then, once completed, `deploy` creates any resources missing from the deployment (and deploys them)


### Changed

- `npx inventory --nuke` now destroys `@static` resources (S3 buckets) and `@events` resources (SNS Topics).
- New projects will no longer create `arc-sessions` tables (for use with `@architect/functions`) by default, and are now explicitly opt-in
- Replaces `progress` module with a lighter weight, more readily cross-platform homegrown solution
